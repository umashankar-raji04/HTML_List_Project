  <p>Bootstrap v5.3.6 was just released to migrate our documentation to Astro from Hugo. Also included are a few bug fixes and documentation updates.

    Here are some highlights:
    
    Ported the docs from Hugo to Astro for our own sanity!
    Added usage docs for Accordion JavaScript
    Prevent .visually-hidden overflowing children to become focusable
    Limit .card-group selectors to immediate children to fix some inheritance issues
    Most importantly, a massive thank you and shoutout to Bootstrap maintainer Julien for all the work that went into our Astro migration. What a massive ship.
